### Performance Farm Benchmarks: bug fixing and change log



#### TODO LIST

* Benchmarks:
  * Fix the collectd part (script for installing collectd to run further tests);
  * Remove unnecessary fields from JSON;
  * Pull pg_stat_statement data;
  * Save results locally with flag;
* API:
  * Collectd tables when that is implemented;
  * Email the user if a machine changes kernel;
* Website:
  * Add admin: crud for pretty much everything, added by hand;
  * What kind of queries would people want from the data?
  * What other benchmarks (tools, options) would people be interested in?
  * Display data within the same branches and maybe also within all branches;
  * Display older commits (v-window); 
  * Add memory and swap in machine page, hz, cpu cores;
  * Change endpoints making them official;
  * UI bugs:
    * Trends page branches have undersized plot;
    * Add tooltips in profile;
    * Favicon not working;

# Google Summer of Code 2019 - report

The 2019 Google Summer of Code project consists in working on the Develop Performance Farm Database and Website, work in progress from 2018. 

The system consists in an API root at the localhost address (127.0.0.1) which generates JSON performance files, 

The current application has been built on Python and its module Django, but is missing some features:

* Client cannot upload results to the website;
* Authentication/authorization tied into the community infrastructure;
* Associating test systems with users to upload results to the REST API;
* Checking if a mapping with the same name already exists (`runner.py`);
* Testing account exit appropriately (`collectd.py`);
* Collecting output of configure and making commands (`git.py`);
* API root, the OPTIONS button cannot be unclicked once clicked;
* Graphical interface improvements while viewing JSON results on the local server (i.e. adding back navigation); 
* Adding test cases of different scale sets (scale=10,20â€¦);
* Allowing custom tests to be added;
* Allowing building the local application with Node > 9;
* Website and interface fixes:
  * Improving responsivity when rescaling the window;
  * Bug fixes (popups when clicking Status/Machine without being logged in);
  * Improving design of the homepage and login form;
  * PG PERF FARM and Home redirect to the same page;
  * Contact, License and Privacy Policy pages missing;
  * There might be an issue with URLs not redirecting properly.

In the meanwhile, testing is being made with manually created accounts, although there are some server-side issues related to login.

The system is being developed using Debian 9 and OSX Mojave.



## Community bonding

#### Migrating from Python2.7 to Python3

Since Python2.7 is no longer going to be maintained in 2020, the community agrees that migrating is necessary. The latest stable version of Python is Python3.6, and Python3.7 has had some issues with older versions of Django, hence I am going to use the first if I find bugs.

The major changes encountered are:

* `import` syntax;
* `print` syntax;
* Manually compiled requirements with pip3;
* Upgraded the Django version (see below);
* Error while installing psycopg2:
  * `env LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" pip install psycopg2` on Mac, with Xcode developer tools and openssl;

Changes have been added to `requirements.txt`. 

Everything works so far: migrations have no issues, yet there are a couple warnings when accessing the server from browser - I will look into that.



#### Django version

Using Django1.11 is recommended because the authentication module is on a Django application, so there might be incompatibilies. The version has nonetheless being updated from 1.11.10 to 1.11.17, since the older one has bugs concerning Python3.



#### Code specifics

*client*: contains packages with functions used to generate test results and files, with exception handling. Results are collected with Python modules which analyse hardware, system and database performance. 

*front-end*: contains HTML, CSS and JS code the website is built on, using the React framework.

*web*: contains testing functions, role definitions in the authentication system and parsing of the JSON file, along with conversion of existent results in a downloadable format.



## Coding Phase 1

#### Week 1

Some minor changes are made to the front-end interface, to get acquainted with the source code without risking bugs:

* "Sign in" changed to "Log in" in the homepage;
* Changed the homepage text.

Locally running the website developing a React application through `yarn install` and `yarn run dev` is the best option to test changes, yet those only work with Node between 4 and 9 due to Webpack issues, concerning upath@1.0.4: there is no available official fix aside from ignoring dependencies.

The website is being tested using Node8.16.0, and Yarn1.16.0.



Setting up Vue.js applying minor changes which shouldn't compromise functioning:

* Adding Vue and Bootstrap to the local API, in `base.html`;
* Adding TemplateView to `urls.py`.



#### Week 2

Creating a PWA using Vue:

cd pgperffarm-front-end

npm install

npm run dev
